If you feel like your home is lacking a little something, try adding some of these plants to instantly lift a space and make it feel fresh and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiddle Leaf Fig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loved for their large, glossy leaves, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) are the ‘it’ plant of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Fiddle%20fig%203.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiddle fig 3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plant adds a sculptural element and wow factor to a room. Be sure to place in an area that gets bright filtered light, but not direct sunlight so the leaves don’t burn. As they come from a tropical climate, it is advised to keep the plant steadily moist and in a warm room if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String of Bananas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trailing succulent produces long tendrils of tiny green banana-like leaves. String of Bananas (Senecio radicans) looks great in hanging baskets or on windowsills where the foliage can trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/String%20of%20Bananas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;String of Bananas.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The String of Bananas enjoys filtered sunlight and being a succulent, only needs watering when the soil is dry. They like porous soil with good drainage. NOTE: This plant may be toxic to pets so place somewhere where they aren’t able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother In Law’s Tongue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being a great conversation starter with its name, the Mother in Law’s Tongue - named for their long, sharpley-shaped leaves - are enjoying a revival back into home decor fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Mother-in-laws-tongue1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mother-in-laws-tongue1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding structure to modern, contemporary and retro structures, the Mother in Law’s Tongue is a sturdy plant who can tolerate most conditions, though prefers full, bright sunlight. They only require water once a month and will die if you over water them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZZ Plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an ability to tolerate neglect, the ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) has been a favourite for people who are after a low maintenance plant.&lt;/p&gt;
