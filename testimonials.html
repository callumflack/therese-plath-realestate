					<p>This was an uncomplicated sale with a willing seller and a willing buyer. The offer price was fair and no conditions of note required. The agency staff were the conduit for a speedy and painless sale/ purchase process. Common sense and attention to requests for information were evident in the short negotiation period. Very happy with manner and result.</p>

<p><em>— Rodney and Janine, Bentley Park</em></p>

<p>Hi Just a quick note to express our delight in working with Tamara, Therese and team on this purchase we very very impressed of the professional approach.</p>

<p><em>— Dennis and Fiona, Bayview Heights</em></p>

<p>3 very lovely ladies that are very helpful. Thank you for everything!</p>

<p><em>— Kayla, Bentley Park</em></p>

<p>I could not speak more highly of these amazing 3 women. They are truly miracle makers!! I would not go past Ray White Cairns Central for either selling; buying or renting your home.</p>

<p><em>— Sharon, Bentley Park</em></p>

<p>Having built this home and decorated it in a style that was rather unique, we knew that there may be a challenge ahead of us with selling. From our very first meeting with Therese, we knew that we had employed a true professional in her field, and also a lady who saw huge potential to selling our home. Like Therese, Jody was always there for us or only a quick phone call away. Her dedication and honesty along with her never ending positive attitude and friendliness made selling our home a stress free experience. The result being a better than expected price. Therese, Jody and Tamara are highly skilled, supportive and committed and I would have no hesitation in recommending Therese Plath and her amazing team. Thank you !</p>

<p><em>— Jack and Jo, Bentley Park</em></p>

<p>We are so grateful and happy with the results of our sale, our experience with the team was positive at all times. We can’t thank them enough for the manner and expertise they handled the sale of our house.</p>

<p><em>— Gary and Valarie, Edmonton</em></p>

<p>It has been a pleasure to deal with your company. It is great to deal with people whom have the same enthusiasm as we do in customer satisfaction. I would like to make special mention towards Jodie Kneebone who has corresponded with us through the whole process and has been available on numerous occasions to show us through the house and has been on hand for our every phone call. Should we ever need to purchase a house again, you can expect our phone call. But don’t hold your breath because we think you have sold us the best. Brendan and Paula and family.</p>

<p><em>— Brendan and Paula, Edmonton</em></p>

<p>Therese Plath’s local knowledge is outstanding, she is always professional &amp; offers great advice. We are very happy with Therese &amp; her team also.</p>

<p><em>— Gary and Di, Edmonton</em></p>

<p>Could not have asked for more!!! When we decided to sell our home we already knew who we wanted and we were certainly not disappointed. Our initial meeting with Therese, Jodie &amp; Tamara inspired nothing but confidence in regards to selling our home. We were given extremely helpful and informative information which left us with no questions needing to be asked. We were very fortunate to sell our home within a week of it being listed and I have no doubt that this was due to the professional and enthusiastic approach that Therese, Jodie and Tamara display. We would highly recommend Therese and her team to anyone who is looking to sell or buy as we truly believe you would be dealing with Cairns’ number one real estate agent.</p>

<p><em>— Chris and Steve</em></p>

<p>Hi Therese, Jodie and Tamara. It is with pleasure that I write to you all, to thank you for putting in the hard yards and effort to achieve the sale of my home at 11 Roma Close Forest Gardens. Therese I appreciate your professional approach and willingness to assist me with a difficult decision that had to be made. Mine was an difficult home to market and sell, being not of the normal desired 3 bed 2 bath configuration and a one off design in todays difficult times. Through your hard work and professional approach you achieved the sale at an acceptable figure, whereas another well know Estate Agent here in Cairns could not even attract one person in 12 weeks of listing to view my home. It was not a quick sale with the home on and off the market over a long period of time, but that was partly my fault as the first firm offer you ever approached me with was right on the mark for the market. Therese, you, and your willing, hard working associates Jodie up front and personal, and Tamara beavering away in the office, were the epitome of professional marketing at all times, especially as I had no budget for advertising at all. I thank you for your professional willing and at all times pleasant approach to a difficult task. Gratefully yours</p>

<p><em>— Phil Crockford</em></p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank Therese &amp; Jodie for their support during the sale process of our house, in a slower market than we have been used to over the recent years. Both Therese &amp; Jodie continue to be proactive in searching for our next dream property, and we respect their professional can-do attitudes. Their assistance is greatly appreciated and we have formed a wonderful ongoing working relationship with them, and would not hesitate recommending them to anyone purchasing or selling a property.</p>

<p><em>— Sam &amp; Belinda</em></p>

<p>What excellent service and professionalism. We did not think we were going to have difficulties selling our Defence House Australia (DHA) investment home in Cairns. However, things don’t always go to plan do they? Living in Melbourne and selling in Cairns was a challenge in itself. Having no luck with the first agent, it was a blessing to find another agent willing to take up the challenge. However, to sell the home was going to take something extra, which Therese and the team demonstrated willingly. They demonstrated over and above the role as agent to ensure the home was presentable on open days and inspection appointments. Always available to communicate and in the end, I felt like a friend sold my home for us, not an agent trying to meet their target sales for the month. The sale resulted in a win win for all parties and I would recommend Therese and the team to anyone wishing to sell their home and wanting that little bit extra to make the experience a good one. Thank you Therese and team for your professionalism, warm friendly approach to your clients and going the extra mile which resulted in the ultimate outcome - HOUSE SOLD.</p>

<p><em>— Ian and Lili Robinson</em></p>

<p>We found Therese, Jodie and Tamara of Ray White Central very dedicated and helpful in both buying our new house and selling our previous one. Their friendly, personal approach provided us with constant feedback and flexibility with advertising and ‘Open House’ situations. With perserverence and determination, they achieved a realistic price for us, considering the difficult market in which we were buying and selling. We were very satisfied with the teams services and would recommend them to others.</p>

<p><em>— Michael and Kath O’Halloran</em></p>

<p>“I recently had the pleasure of listing my Kanimbla Hts home with Ray White, Aplin St, Cairns. Therese Plath and her Team of dedicated professionals were just that - Courteous, prompt, informative and efficient from the first day we met until sale. Therese Plath has vast experience in the Cairns Real Estate Market and was able to provide me with a broad range of marketing strategies to suit my needs. My house sold within 4 weeks of advertisement, while numerous other houses listed prior to mine in surrounding suburbs remained unsold by other agents. I was extremely happy with the final sale price, with Therese negotiating a higher settlement figure than I first anticipated. I have no hesitation in recommending Therese Plath and her team from Ray White, to anyone wishing to sell their property</p>

<p><em>— Brett Mackenzie</em></p>

<p>We wish to thank the team at Ray White Real Estate Cairns Central for all their dedication and hard work. Selling a house can be a very stressful experience however Therese, Jodie and the team showed us commitment and a very professional approach at all times. We appreciate their keeping us constantly updated and informed throughout the whole process and also their effort to achieve very close to our asking price. I would recommend Ray White Cairns to anyone considering selling or buying. Once again thanks so much, we really appreciate everything you have done.</p>

<p><em>— Scott &amp; Brenda Suter</em></p>

<p>This note is a very belated thank you for all your assistance in the purchase of our new home in Forest Gardens.We have been in our home two weeks already and are slowly settling in (still have to unpack about 30 boxes)!!Just wanted to say it was lovely dealing with you and to thank you for your kindness to both Derek and myself. We really do love our new home and are very happy with everything! Thank you again and we will certainly be in touch if we ever need to sell and move on. Our daughter also may be looking for a unit towards the end of this year, so we will contact you as the time draws closer.</p>

<p><em>— Maureen &amp; Derek Worthy</em></p>

<p>Therese and her team gems in the real estate world. Purchasing a property with Therese was a pleasant and a winning experience. I also would like to thank the previous owner for enlisting her gorgeous property with Therese, as I now have met the most caring, honest &amp; professional Real Estate agents in Cairns. Whether you have a flat battery or your husband works away and getting a contract signed becomes an issue, their reassurance that everything will be alright, helped my husband and I purchase our new property. I would like to say a special thank you to Therese and her team as they did go the extra mile for us and I have no hesitation in recommending them to all our family and friends.</p>

<p><em>— Jackie Newell &amp; Gabe</em></p>

<p>Wayne and I would like to Thank you for your professionalism,effort and care you have given us from day one, when Ray White took over from another real estate to looked after our investment property. We knew we made the right decision, the care and service we received was just excellent. What an amazing team!!! They stayed in touch with us throughout the whole process of selling our property, our home and purchasing our new home. We highly recommend Therese and her team either selling or purchasing your home :)</p>

<p><em>— Wayne &amp; Mary Boylett</em></p>

<p>What a beautiful surprise – so unique and totally unexpected – thank you so much. I have just had the fenced moved back to give us more garden – so the gift voucher will come in very useful. Thank you both for the amount of unseemly tireless energy and effort put into achieving our dream.</p>

<p><em>— Chris &amp; Ron Thompson</em></p>

<p>From the start we were impressed by Therese Plath’s warm friendly approach, she and Jodie make a great team and catered to our personalised needs. With two young children flexibility and understanding of my needs was essential, both Therese and Jodie knew exactly how to help. A steady detailed flow of information about potential buyers, the local market and information on a wide scale was always at hand to keep myself and family informed. Therese brings a wealth of knowledge, professionalism, and calmness to the sale process. Jodie presents an energetic approach with a wonderful positive attitude who is a delight to welcome into our home to assist with the sale process. With persistence and determination, Therese and Jodie made the sale for us in what is a tough market at the moment. We were very satisfied with the end result and having Therese and her team as our sale agents has been a absolute pleasure.</p>

<p><em>— Kim Ingham</em></p>

<p>We found Therese and Jodie to be a fantastic team. They constantly stayed in touch with us throughout the whole process. Perhaps most importantly, they provided sound advice, guidance and options on the best direction and then gave us time to make up our own mind without any pressure. I would thoroughly recommend Therese and Jodie to anyone looking to sell their house for the best price in the current market.</p>

<p><em>— Don and Katy Mckay</em></p>

<p>Giving Sole Agency for the sale of my home to Ray White Cairns Central was a very wise move indeed. Therese Plath and her assistants e looked after me in such a kind and professional manner, I would certainly recommend them to anyone contemplating selling their property. They guided me through the process which resulted in a sale in just a few short weeks. They made what can be a very stressful time a lot easier and I still think of them as friends. I am grateful to them both for their caring attitude towards me.</p>

<p><em>— Wendy Knox</em></p>

<p>Who would have thought that selling your “castle” could be so pain free? When we decided to buy another home in Cairns that would be suited to our needs, it was necessary for us to sell our lovely little home in Bayview Heights. A friend had suggested contacting Therese and her team, as they had been impressed with the service provided when marketing their property. After discussing the sale and showing our home to Therese, who was more than happy to work into our schedule, and signing the necessary paperwork, Therese contacted persons who she knew were interested in property in the area. From this contact, and a small advertisement which was placed in the Saturday Realtor, the property was shown and sold within 4 days!! We never felt pressured or manipulated, and were very thankful for the professional advice and guidance that we received from both Therese and Jodie. They made what could have been a stressful process easy, efficient and effective. If we ever buy or sale real estate in this area in the future, we will be heading straight to Therese Plath and her team at Ray White Central Cairns.</p>

<p><em>— Colleen Steel</em></p>

<p>What an exciting experience!! Selling a house with Therese was so wonderful. When we put the house on the market with Ray White Central we had no idea how passionate, how professional and how organized Therese was. We spoke with Therese, who organized a caravan of other agents to see our house the next day. We were really impressed to see the agents immediately on the phone, contacting their list of customers.Therese sold our house after two open homes over two to three weeks. We sold the house for a price that was over what we expected in this current market. We would highly recommend Therese, her staff and Ray White Central. A great bunch of people.</p>

<p><em>— Sandy &amp; Gavin</em></p>

<p>We just wanted to say we felt confident with Therese as the agent we were purchasing our home from. Therese was always helpful in answering our questions and not only did she always operate professionally but she also made us feel like we were friends.</p>

<p><em>— Deanne and Brett Duncan</em></p>

<p>Please accept our sincere thanks for your professionalism, genuine care and attention to details in the sale of our home and purchase of an investment home. Selling and moving home can be very stressful, you made us feel comfortable and relaxed and provided a confidence to us that all the details were being taken care of. Your commitment to quality in all you have done for us is much appreciated. There are lots of little things that have meant a lot to us, the way you took an interest in our children and indeed our pets. Letting our dog Murphy out of his cage after open homes showed your care and attention without being asked. These little things are the reason we will continue to utilise your services Therese both now and into the future. Despite having already moved interstate, your professionalism continued in meeting our every requirement including facilitating all facets of purchasing our investment house. At all times we felt confident that we were kept fully informed and any enquiries were promptly dealt with. Once again, thankyou Therese for all your hard work Kind Regards, Patrick and Linda Korman and family.</p>

<p><em>— Patrick and Linda Korman and family</em></p>

<p>We would just like to say a big thank you to both of you for the brilliant service when we purchased our home from you. You both made us all feel so comfortable and we both were very pleased that there was no pressure to buy. You both made us feel like family and not just another client, and that is very important. We are very pleased with our new home and thank you both for finding it for us, I am sure it will bring many years of memories for us all. The service from your office is outstanding, our calls were always returned very quickly. Many, many thanks, Bruce, Lesa, Brenden and Cindy</p>
