Yesterday we had the domain.com.au coffee van down at the office to warm our clients up on a raining and miserable morning. For Real Estate people, they do pretty good tall, non-fat latte with caramel drizzle.

It was a wonderful morning with plenty of fun had by all, though we all needed a nap after enjoying a few too many cookies and muffins. Come again please!
