The 70's trend is back so it's time to bring the garden inside and bring new life to your interior.

If you feel like your home is lacking a little something, try adding some of these plants  to instantly lift a space and make it feel fresh and welcoming.

**Fiddle Leaf Fig**

Loved for their large, glossy leaves, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) are the 'it' plant of the moment.

This plant adds a sculptural element and wow factor to a room. Be sure to place in an area that gets bright filtered light, but not direct sunlight so the leaves don't burn. As they come from a tropical climate, it is advised to keep the plant steadily moist and in a warm room if possible.

**String of Bananas**

This trailing succulent produces long tendrils of tiny green banana-like leaves. String of Bananas (Senecio radicans) looks great in hanging baskets or on windowsills where the foliage can trail.

The String of Bananas enjoys filtered sunlight and being a succulent, only needs watering when the soil is dry. They like porous soil with good drainage. NOTE: This plant may be toxic to pets so place somewhere where they aren't able to access it.

**Mother In Law's Tongue**

Besides being a great conversation starter with its name, the Mother in Law's Tongue - named for their long, sharpley-shaped leaves - are enjoying a revival back into home decor fashion.

Adding structure to modern, contemporary and retro structures, the Mother in Law's Tongue is a sturdy plant who can tolerate most conditions, though prefers full, bright sunlight. They only require water once a month and will die if you over water them.

**ZZ Plant**

With an ability to tolerate neglect, the ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) has been a favourite for people who are after a low maintenance plant.
